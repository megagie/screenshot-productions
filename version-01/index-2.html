        <h3>Membership Benefits</h3>

        <h4>Screenshot Productions membership includes the following:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Exclusive access to all chapters of the ongoing, immersive life experience mentioned in your email.</li>
                <li>Admission to every Screenshot production throughout the year (at least 1 production per quarter)</li>
                <li>First choice of timeslot for all productions.</li>
                <li>After-hours “lights-on” tour of each production (excluding the chapters)</li>
                <li>Separate, fully-produced show created specifically for you only (1 per year).</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Other Notes:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The membership is billed on a quarterly cycle, meaning each membership is active for 3 months from the date of purchase.</li>
                <li>The membership activates from the purchase date. You do not have to wait until the 1st of the month (or any specific date) to begin.</li>
                <li>You may cancel the subscription at any time, however, once a cycle has been purchased, there are no refunds or cancellations.</li>
                <li>If you wish to suspend your membership and come back after any period of time, the chapter-based experience will simply resume where you left off. (you will not miss any of the experience if you cannot continue your membership in consecutive quarters).</li>

                <li>We will contact you regarding the personal show after a full year of membership (again, does not need to be consecutive).</li> 
                <li>This is a truly on-going experience, meaning that if you had someone else in mind that would like to sign-up for a membership, chapter 1 would begin at the time of their sign-up regardless of when they enroll.</li>
            </ul>    

        If you have any other questions about the membership, please <a href="mailto:members@whatwelearnedhere.com">contact us.</a>
