    <h3>Screenshot Productions is a newly formed, immersive installation collective with a long-term vision to establish a year-round immersive experience culture here in Los Angeles.</h3> 

    <p>The company has been inspired by the collaborative, immersive scene in New York and hopes to bring something similar to the west coast. However, they don't simply wish to replicate existing models for what constitutes an immersive production, but instead forge ahead with their own take on where they think the industry can go. The vision is to continually push what an immersive experience can be and what audience members can get out of it, always with an agenda for the productions staged. The hope is that each art installation created by Screenshot taps into universal human emotions in some meaningful way and that the art has a genuine emotional impact on those who attend.</p>
