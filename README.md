A static website for immersive art collective Screenshot Productions, utilizing Middleman.


## About Middleman

Middleman is a static site generator built in Ruby. This makes it a great fit
for projects that may end up as a Ruby on Rails app. Its minimalistic structure
makes it very easy to work with, and includes support for deploying to Github
Pages.

## Includes

* [HAML](http://haml.info):
  Simple template markup
* [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org):
  Write javascript with simpler syntax
* [Sass (LibSass)](http://sass-lang.com):
  CSS with superpowers
* [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io):
  Sass mixin library
* [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io):
  Semantic grid for Sass and Bourbon
* [Bitters](http://bitters.bourbon.io):
  Scaffold styles, variables and structure for Bourbon projects.
* [Middleman Live Reload](https://github.com/middleman/middleman-livereload):
  Reloads the page when files change
* [Middleman Deploy](https://github.com/karlfreeman/middleman-deploy):
  Deploy your Middleman build via rsync, ftp, sftp, or git (deploys to Github Pages by default)

We also recommend [Refills](http://refills.bourbon.io/) for prepackaged interface patterns and [Proteus](http://github.com/thoughtbot/proteus) for a collection of useful
starter kits to help you prototype faster.
